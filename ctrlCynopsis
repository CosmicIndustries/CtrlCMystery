🧠 Key Findings (2015–2025)
1. Software Bugs and Configuration Issues:
  DLL-Related Bugs: There have been instances where DLLs, such as libifcoremd.dll, have caused applications to abort upon receiving a Ctrl+C event.
    For example, a user reported a forrtl: error (200) when using PyMC3 in Visual Studio Code, indicating a runtime failure linked to DLL handling of Ctrl+C signals .​PyMC Discourse

  Console Applications: In some cases, console applications fail to handle Ctrl+C correctly due to improper configuration of control handlers. For instance, using SetConsoleCtrlHandler improperly can lead to the application ignoring Ctrl+C inputs .​Stack Overflow+1DEV Community+1

  Development Environment Issues: Certain development environments, like Visual Studio, have been reported to interfere with Ctrl+C functionality in child processes. This is often due to inherited settings that disable Ctrl+C handling .​

2. Third-Party Software Conflicts:
Global Hotkey Interception: Applications or scripts that set global hotkeys can intercept Ctrl+C, preventing it from reaching its intended target. For example, AutoHotKey scripts have been known to cause such issues .​Stack Overflow

  Clipboard Managers: Some clipboard management tools can interfere with standard copy-paste operations, leading to Ctrl+C failures. Disabling or uninstalling these tools often resolves the issue .​GeeksforGeeks

3. Driver and System-Level Issues:
Keyboard Drivers: Outdated or corrupted keyboard drivers can cause Ctrl+C to stop working. Updating the drivers through Device Manager has been a recommended solution .​GeeksforGeeks+1TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM+1

  System Updates: Missing or pending Windows updates can also lead to unexpected behavior with keyboard shortcuts. Ensuring the system is up-to-date is a common troubleshooting step .​GeeksforGeeks

📈 Trend Analysis
  The recurrence of these issues in forums and technical communities over the past ten years suggests a persistent pattern.  
  The problems often correlate with software updates, changes in system configurations, or the installation of new third-party applications.​

🛡️ Malware Consideration
  There is limited evidence to suggest that malware is a common cause of Ctrl+C failures. 
  While malware can theoretically intercept or disable keyboard inputs, such behavior is typically part of broader malicious activity and would likely present additional symptoms. 
  The majority of reported cases point towards non-malicious software conflicts or misconfigurations.​

✅ Recommendations
  Update Software and Drivers: Ensure all applications, especially those related to development environments and keyboard input, are up-to-date.​
  Review Third-Party Applications: Identify and disable any third-party tools that may intercept keyboard inputs, such as clipboard managers or global hotkey scripts.​GeeksforGeeks
  Check System Configurations: Verify that system settings and control handlers are properly configured to allow Ctrl+C functionality.​
  Consult Technical Communities: Engage with forums and support communities for specific applications to find tailored solutions to Ctrl+C issues.​

By focusing on these areas, users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve most Ctrl+C functionality problems without attributing them to malware.
